Raspberry Pi Smart Doorbell

This program uses the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi and a breadboard in order to create a smart doorbell. It uses the smtplib and OpenCV libraries in order to implement facial detection and automated email alerts.

This project requires you to download OpenCV: https://opencv.org/blog/raspberry-pi-with-opencv/

The physical components needed for this project include:
    1. Breadboard
    2. Male-Male and Female-Male wires
    3. Raspberry Pi Camera Module (Web-cam is also sufficient)
    4. Ultrasonic Distance Sensor (HC-SR04)
    5. Button
    6. Piezoelectric Buzzer
    7. 470OHM and 260OHM resistors
